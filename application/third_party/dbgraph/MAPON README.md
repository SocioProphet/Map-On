# Database Graph
(Note: We recommend to read this file through bitbucket or using a markdown reader.)

The database graph that mapon shows in "Database" tab.

__Installation__

* Download and install Node.js from http://nodejs.org/download/
* Run 'npm install' in 'application/third_party/dbgraph' directory, this will create a node_modules directory.


__Directories__

* node_modules: Folder auto generated by node with the requiered packages.

* wwwsqldesigner: Source code of the database graph, from 'https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner' commit 'Nov 20, 2015'. And it was NOT modified.

* app: This directory contains the modifications over wwwsqldesigner in order to work with mapon. It only overrides the functions that we need to change.


__How to modify dbgraph code__

1. You might not change the wwwsqldesigner code (so if we want to update the aplication we only have to insert the latest commit from github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner in this directory)

2. In order to modify dbgraph modify the code in app directory.

3. Compile with CMD (Windows terminal):

	> cd <project path>\application\third_party\dbgraph

	> grunt

	This will generate public/js/external/dbgraph/wwwsqldesigner.min.js file. (Configured in Gruntfile.js)
