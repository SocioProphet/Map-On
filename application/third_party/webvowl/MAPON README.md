# Web Vowl Graph
(Note: We recommend to read this file through bitbucket or using a markdown reader.)

The Ontology graph that mapon shows in "Ontology" tab.


__Installation__

* Download and install Node.js from http://nodejs.org/download/
* Run 'npm install' in 'application/third_party/webvowl' directory, this will create a node_modules directory.
* With SourceTree (Or a git client) clone the git __submodule__ placed in application\third_party\webvowl\WebVowl

__Directories__

* node_modules: Folder auto generated by nodeJS with the requiered packages.

* WebVowl: Source code of the ontology graph. It's a fork of the original code with some changes in order to work with mapon.

	Original code: https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL
	Used code: https://github.com/netkuup/WebVOWL

* app: This directory contains the modifications over WebVowl in order to work with mapon. It only overrides the modules that we need to change, and add new ones.


__How to modify WebVowl code__


1. You might not change the WebVowl code (so if we want to update the aplication we only have to insert the latest commit from github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner in this directory)
	
	Until now it was necessary to create some small functions inside WebVowl code in order to work with mapon, so it was not the original code.

2. In order to modify WebVowl you have to modify the code in 'app' directory.

3. Compile with CMD (Windows terminal):

	> cd <project path>\application\third_party\webvowl

	> npm run-script release

	This will generate d3.min.js, webvowl.app.js and webvowl.js files in 'public/js/external/webvowl' directory.
